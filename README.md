# 3D-car-animation-in-OpenGL
The 3D car animation is a animation program made in Codeblocks using GLUT library. The idea behind the program is to navigate the 3D car through the background and see all the different views of the car.

This project was done with the help of C++-Programming Language

Initially one need to press the mouse buttons to select the options
and different keyboard buttons to see the different views of the car. 

Mouse event is generated when the mouse is moved and one of the buttons is pressed.
